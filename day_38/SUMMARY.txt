================================================================================
3. SECURE FILE SYSTEM TOOL (file_system_tool.py)
================================================================================

CORE OPERATIONS:
✓ Read files with validation
✓ Write files with security checks
✓ List directory contents
✓ Delete files safely

SECURITY FEATURES:
✓ Sandbox directory enforcement
✓ Path traversal prevention (../../../)
✓ Absolute path blocking (/etc/passwd)
✓ File type whitelist (.txt, .json, etc.)
✓ File size limits (configurable)
✓ Permission validation

TEST RESULTS - VALID OPERATIONS:
✓ Write and read file: SUCCESS
✓ Nested directories: SUCCESS
✓ List directory: SUCCESS
✓ Delete file: SUCCESS

TEST RESULTS - SECURITY (ALL BLOCKED):
✓ Path traversal: ../../../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Path traversal: ../../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Path traversal: ../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Path traversal: subdir/../../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Path traversal: ./../../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Path traversal: a/../../../etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Absolute path: /etc/passwd - BLOCKED
✓ Absolute path: /tmp/malicious.txt - BLOCKED
✓ Absolute path: /var/log/system.log - BLOCKED
✓ Absolute path: /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa - BLOCKED
✓ Disallowed file type: .exe - BLOCKED
✓ Disallowed file type: .sh - BLOCKED
✓ Disallowed file type: .py - BLOCKED
✓ Disallowed file type: .js - BLOCKED
✓ File size limit: 2MB file - BLOCKED
✓ Read large file: 2KB file - BLOCKED
✓ Write to read-only: BLOCKED

TEST RESULTS - EDGE CASES:
✓ Read non-existent file: Handled
✓ List non-existent directory: Handled
✓ Delete non-existent file: Handled
✓ Read directory as file: Handled
✓ List file as directory: Handled
